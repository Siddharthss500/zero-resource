go O
all O
in O

At O
the O
time O
, O
his O
little O
water-making O

was O

They O
settled O
on O
creating O
little O

inside O

by O
heating O
up O
wood O

to O
produce O
the O
temperature O

needed O
to O
draw O
water O
from O
the O
air O
and O
the O
wood O
itself O
. O

" O
One O
of O
the O
fascinating O
things O
about O
shipping O
containers O
is O
that O
more O
are O
imported O
than O
exported O
, O
so O
there O
's O
generally O
a O
surplus O
, O
" O
said O

adding O
they O
're O
cheap O

easy O
to O

around O

And O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
wood O
chips O
to O
heat O
them O
with O
, O
coconut O

" O
Certainly O
in O

between O
U.S. S-LOC

Chinese S-MISC
officials O
this O
week O
with O
his O
weekend O

that O
hinted O
at O
possibly O
easing O
up O

for O
China S-LOC

Here O

a O

banned O
it O

for O
seven O
years O
after O
it O
misled O

by O
failing O
to O
discipline O
employees O
involved O
in O
illegal O
exports O
and O
paying O
them O
bonuses O
. O

ZTE S-ORG
pleaded O
guilty O
and O
was O
hit O
by O
a O
$ O
1.19 O
billion O
fine O
after O
getting O
caught O
shipping O
cellular O

to O
Iran S-LOC

in O
violation O
of O
U.S S-MISC

at O
keeping O

regimes O
. O

Last O
week O
, O
ZTE S-ORG
said O
it O
had O
suspended O
major O
business O
operations O
because O
the O
U.S. S-LOC
sanctions O
cut O
off O

Catching O
many O
by O
surprise O
, O
on O
Sunday O

that O

" O
are O
working O

" O
Trump S-PER
said O
the O
Commerce O
Department O
was O
told O
to O
" O
get O
it O
done O
! O
" O

Hours O
later O
he O
tweeted O
that O
the O
U.S. S-LOC
and O
China S-LOC
were O
working O
well O
together O
on O
trade O
, O
but O
it O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
work O
out O
a O
deal O
beneficial O
to O
both O
sides O
because O
" O
past O
negotiations O
have O
been O
so O
one O
sided O
in O
favor O
of O
China S-LOC
, O
for O
so O
many O
years O

" O
He O
added O

be O
cool O

it O
will O
all O
work O
out O

During O
China-U.S. S-LOC
trade O
talks O
in O
Beijing S-LOC
earlier O
this O
month O
, O
Chinese S-MISC
officials O
sought O
help O
from O
the O
U.S. S-LOC
delegation O
in O
getting O
the O
ban O
on O
doing O
business O
with O
ZTE S-ORG
lifted O
. O

Those O
talks O
made O
little O
apparent O
progress O
. O
Sunday O

comments O
are O
a O
confusing O
prelude O
to O
further O
talks O
in O
Washington S-LOC
this O
week O
aimed O
at O
resolving O
the O
worst O
trade O
dispute O
with O
Beijing S-LOC
in O
decades O
. O

The O
Chinese S-MISC
delegation O
, O
led O
by O
Liu B-PER

top O
economic O
adviser O
, O
is O
due O
to O
arrive O
on O
Tuesday O
, O
China S-LOC
's O
Foreign O
Ministry O
said O
. O

The O
tensions O
flared O
after O
the O
Trump S-PER
administration O
vowed O
to O
hike O
import O
duties O
on O
Chinese S-MISC
goods O
to O
try O
to O
even O
out O
the O
two O
countries O

lopsided O

they O
also O
reflect O
U.S. S-LOC
resistance O
to O
China S-LOC
's O
efforts O
to O
achieve O
tech O
dominance O
. O

The O
U.S. S-LOC
business O
ban O
is O
devastating O
for O
ZTE S-ORG
because O
the O
company O
relies O
heavily O
on O
U.S. S-LOC
technology O
and O
parts O
that O
are O
hard O
to O

from O

according O
to O

market O
for O
ZTE S-ORG

which O
is O
the O
fourth O
biggest O
smartphone O
vendor O
in O
the O
U.S. S-LOC

The O
U.S. S-LOC
government O
has O
long O
been O
suspicious O
of O
ZTE S-ORG

tech O
firm O

Huawei S-ORG
. O

In O
2012 O

their O

in O
the O
U.S S-MISC

The O
sanctions O
on O
ZTE S-ORG
reflect O
those O
longer-term O
concerns O
and O
highlight O
the O
company O
's O
dependence O
on O
the O
U.S. S-LOC
for O
advanced O

. O

The O
sanctions O

" O

That O
's O
right O
: O
LSD S-MISC
. O
In O
secret O
, O
Waldman S-PER
actually O
began O
taking O
a O
miniscule O
amount O
every O
three O
days O
. O

q O
It O
's O
called O
microdosing O
, O
and O
it O
's O
a O
controversial O
yet O
growing O
trend O
among O
the O
Silicon O
Valley O
crowd O
. O
But O
for O
her O
, O
she O
says O
, O
it O
worked O
. O

" O
You O
do O
n't O
hallucinate O
; O
you O
do O
n't O
see O
anything O
unusual O
, O
" O
Waldman S-PER
said O
. O
" O
Best O
way O
I O
could O
describe O
it O
, O
a O
little O
more O
cheerful O
and O
a O
little O
more O
effective O
at O
work O
, O
like O
, O
a O
little O
more O
productive O
. O
" O

So O
productive O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
she O
wrote O
a O
book O
about O
her O
mind-altering O
experiment O
, O
" O
A O
Really O
Good O
Day O
. O
" O

And O
most O
importantly O
, O
her O
suicidal O
thoughts O
disappeared O
. O

But O
there O
was O
a O
catch O
: O
After O
a O
month O
, O
she O
ran O
out O
of O
the O
small O
supply O
she O
had O
gotten O
a O
hold O
of O
. O
And O
she O
stopped O
microdosing O
. O

Why O
? O
" O
'Cause O
it O
's O
illegal O
, O
" O
Waldman S-PER
said O
. O
" O
If O
it O
were O
n't O
illegal O
, O
I O
would O
still O
be O
doing O
it O
. O
" O

Taking O
LSD S-MISC
, O
even O
a O
tiny O
microdose O
of O
it O
, O
is O
still O
against O
the O
law O
, O
and O
potentially O
dangerous O
. O
But O
once O
upon O
a O
time O
, O
LSD S-MISC
and O
psychedelics O
like O
it O
were O
considered O
potential O
wonder O
drugs O
. O

Throughout O
the O
1940s O
, O
'50s O
, O
and O
into O
the O
'60s O
, O
scientists O
studied O
them O
to O
understand O
mental O
disorders O
like O
schizophrenia O
, O
and O
to O
treat O
anxiety O
, O
depression O
, O
even O
alcoholism O
. O

And O
then O
: O
the O
Controlled O
Substance O
Act O
led O
to O
a O
more O
than O
three O
decades-long O
ban O
on O
all O
psychedelic O
research O
. O

Since O
2003 O
, O
however O
, O
the O
FDA O
has O
allowed O
for O
a O
few O
clinical O
trials O
of O
illegal O
hallucinogens O

drugs O
like O
psilocybin O

Bazer E-PER
beat O
ovarian O
cancer O
back O

the O
fear O

returning O
convinced O
her O
to O
volunteer O
for O

" O
I O
just O
wanted O
this O
terrible O
daily O
anxiety O
to O
go O
away O

" O
she O
told O
Salie S-PER

In O
that O
treatment O

, O
she O
was O
given O
the O
psilocybin O

I O
saw O

" O
And O
it O
was O
a O
black O
mass O
under O

It O
was O

it O
was O
the O
fear O
itself O

And O
it O
made O
me O
so O
mad O

I O
was O
furious O

I O
screamed O
at O
it O
to O
get O
out O
. O
And O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
did O
that O
, O
it O
was O
gone O

" O

When O
the O
drug O
wore O
off O
, O
the O
anxiety O
about O
her O
cancer O
returning O
was O
gone O
, O
and O
still O
is O
. O
What O
remains O
, O
she O
says O
, O
is O
the O
powerful O
memory O
of O
that O
symbolic O
experience O
. O

Dr. O
Tony B-PER
said O
, O
" O
This O
medicine O
you O
take O
once O
, O
it O
's O
out O
of O
their O
system O
in O
a O
few O
hours O
. O
But O
it O
generates O
a O
three- O
to O
four-hour O
, O
incredible O
transcendent O
experience O
. O
And O
it O
's O
the O
memory O
of O
that O
experience O
that O
recalibrates O
how O
they O
view O
life O
and O
death O
and O
their O
existence O
, O
and O
give O
you O
very O
spiritual O
insights O
. O
" O

If O
that O
all O
sounds O
a O
bit O
far-out O

may O

of O
the O

areas O
that O
normally O

" O
Maybe O
it O

's O
decision O
to O
replace O
its O

in O
the O

widely O

from O

criticized O
the O

and O
what O
he O
viewed O
as O
a O
ULA S-ORG

Musk S-PER
also O
criticized O
the O
high O
cost O

, O
which O
uses O

out O
on O

some O

freely O

A O
skirt O
about O
10 O
feet O
deep O
was O
supposed O
to O
catch O
the O
plastic O
, O
but O
that O
also O
did O
n't O
go O
as O
planned O
. O

" O
The O
system O
is O

able O
to O
retain O
the O

once O
it O

also O
sometimes O
see O
it O
floating O
out O
again O

" O
Slat S-PER

It O
picked O
up O
4,500 O

of O

is O
not O
nearly O
enough O

to O
some O

. O

" O
You O
will O
have O
more O
plastics O
there O
next O
week O
and O
the O
week O
after O
, O
so O
the O
real O
answer O
is O
to O
not O
consume O
so O
many O

Robert B-PER
Reed E-PER

nearly O
20 O

if O
we O

Mackiewicz S-PER

he O
has O
felt O
the O
impacts O
of O

firsthand O
. O

He O
said O
his O
wake-up O
call O
came O
in O
2009 O
when O
his O
oyster O
farm O
started O
having O
trouble O
producing O
oysters O
. O

The O
challenge O
was O
growing O
oyster O
larvae O
, O
which O
mature O
into O
oysters O
that O
we O
can O
eventually O
eat O
. O
They O
are O
very O
sensitive O
to O
changes O
in O
the O
acidity O
level O
of O
the O
water O
. O

" O
We O
realized O
that O
we O
were O
having O
a O
pH O
problem O
, O
an O
acidification O
problem O
, O
and O
started O
buffering O
our O
water O
, O
which O
is O
the O
equivalent O
of O
putting O
Tums O
in O
the O
water O

" O
What O
was O
surprising O
was O
that O
when O
we O
started O
doing O
that O

it O
was O
literally O

examined O
critical O

insulin O
pumps O
 O
devices O
that O
help O
keep O

alive O

found O
all O

vulnerabilities O
that O
would O
allow O

take O

of O
the O
machines O
. O
The O
reason O
? O
All O
of O
those O
devices O
are O
run O
by O
computers O
 O
and O
computers O
can O
be O
hacked O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
take O
an O
insulin O
pump O
made O
by O
device O
manufacturer O
Medtronic S-ORG
. O

" O
Anyone O
that O
has O
this O

one O
of O
these O

, O
we O
can O
take O
it O
over O
, O
" O
Rios S-PER
said O

They O
showed O
us O
how O
they O
can O
send O
a O
wireless O

, O
telling O
the O
pump O
to O
deliver O
the O
wrong O
amount O
of O
insulin O
to O
a O
patient O
nearby O
who O
might O
be O
wearing O
it O
. O
They O
also O
found O
vulnerabilities O
in O
a O
Medtronic S-ORG
pacemaker O
that O
could O
allow O
a O
hacker O
to O
reprogram O
the O
device O
from O
anywhere O
 O
disrupting O
a O
patient O
's O
heart O
rhythms O
in O
a O
way O
that O
could O
hurt O

kill O
them O

They O
're O
scenarios O
that O
, O
until O
now O
, O
have O
been O
the O
stuff O
of O
TV O
shows O
like O
" O
Homeland O

" O

" O
It O
sounds O
like O
a O
method O
for O

, O
" O
Werner S-PER
said O

" O
Am O
I O
right O
? O
" O

" O
Yeah O
, O
there O

 O
I O

, O
there O

no O
coming O
back O
from O

of O
these O

, O
right O
? O
" O
Rios S-PER

" O
If O
a O

for O
a O

gets O
hacked O

you O

" O

The O
pacemaker O
vulnerability O
was O
serious O
enough O
they O
thought O
Medtronic S-ORG
would O
want O
to O
address O
it O
immediately O
. O

So O
in O
January O
of O
2017 O
, O
they O
sent O
the O
company O
a O
report O
detailing O
what O
they O
'd O
found O
. O

" O
It O
seemed O
to O
us O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
was O
being O
downplayed O
by O
the O
manufacturer O
, O
" O
Rios S-PER
said O
. O
" O

I O
mean O
, O
they O
were O
saying O
, O
'Hey O
, O
this O
is O
n't O
 O
this O
is O
n't O
possible O
. O

It O
's O
not O
feasible O
. O
' O
The O
way O
that O
they O
characterized O
it O
is O
wrong O
. O
" O

" O
They O
were O
just O
completely O
disagreeing O
with O
everything O
, O
" O
Butts S-PER
said O
. O

So O
the O
two O
researchers O
decided O
they O
had O
to O
prove O
it O
by O
writing O
the O
code O
, O
then O
demonstrating O
the O
potential O
dangers O
of O
both O
the O
pacemaker O
and O
the O
insulin O
pump O
at O
a O
prestigious O
information O
security O
conference O
. O

" O
After O
the O
two O
live O
demonstrations O
, O
people O
actually O
stood O
up O
and O
clapped O
, O
which O
was O
kind O
of O
 O
took O
us O
by O
surprise O
, O
" O
Rios S-PER
said O
. O

Medtronic S-ORG
's O
response O
? O
The O
company O
issued O
a O
statement O
saying O
it O
had O
addressed O
the O
problem O
and O
that O
" O
existing O
security O
controls O
mitigate O
the O
issue O
. O
" O
But O
the O
vulnerability O
caught O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
FDA S-ORG
. O

" O
Any O
device O
can O
be O
hacked O
and O
that O
's O
often O
not O
understood O

" O
said O
Dr. O
Suzanne B-PER
Schwartz E-PER
, O
who O

at O
the O

. O
She O
said O

playing O
catch-up O
. O

" O
It O
's O
a O
culture O
shift O
, O
" O
Schwartz S-PER
said O
. O
" O
So O
the O
actions O

the O
activities O
that O
we O
're O
seeing O
manufacturers O
take O
are O
very O
encouraging O
, O
they O
're O
very O
promising O
, O
but O
we O
still O
have O
a O
ways O
to O
go O
. O
" O

In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
Medtronic S-ORG
pacemaker O
, O
the O
researchers O
' O
work O
prompted O
the O
FDA S-ORG
to O
start O
asking O
questions O
of O
its O
own O
. O

" O
That O
was O
when O
Medtronic S-ORG
finally O
came O
out O
and O
said O
what O
we O
had O
been O
saying O
all O
along O
was O
indeed O
correct O
. O

That O
there O
is O
remote O
concern O
, O
and O
there O
is O
potential O
to O
cause O
patient O
harm O
, O
" O
Butts S-PER
said O
. O

Last O
month O
, O
the O
FDA S-ORG
took O
action O
, O
sending O
out O
a O
warning O
about O
certain O
Medtronic S-ORG
pacemakers O
, O
and O
the O
company O
issued O
a O
software O
fix O
. O

Medtronic S-ORG
has O
also O
instructed O
users O
of O
its O
insulin O
pumps O
to O
disable O
certain O
features O
to O
minimize O
risks O
. O

The O
company O
declined O
an O
on-camera O
interview O
, O
but O
in O
a O
statement O
to O
CBS B-ORG

admitted O

the O

discovered O
by O
the O
two O

" O
So O
do O
you O
feel O
vindicated O
? O
" O
Werner S-PER
asked O
. O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
we O
're O
looking O
for O
vindication O

" O
Butts S-PER

want O
to O
move O
and O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
fix O
their O
devices O
, O
I O
hope O
they O
realize O
that O
the O
repercussions O
are O
really O
serious O
. O
And O
we O
ca O
n't O
wait O
for O
something O
to O
happen O

told O
CBS B-ORG
News E-ORG
foreign O
correspondent O
Debora B-PER
Patta E-PER
the O
reason O
for O
the O
eclipse O
's O
length O
was O
because O
of O
the O
distances O
between O
the O
Earth O
and O
the O
moon O
and O
between O
the O
Earth O
and O
the O
sun O
. O

On O

the O

would O
reach O
its O
farthest O
point O

Earth O
 O
about O
250,000 O

the O

Van B-PER

" O
We O
will O
see O
totality O
eclipses O
happening O
again O
, O
but O
nothing O
this O
long O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
" O
This O
is O
the O
longest O
for O
the O
next O
hundred-odd O
years O
. O
" O

Because O
the O
moon O
was O
at O
the O
farthest O
point O
on O
its O
orbit O
from O
Earth O
, O
its O
movement O
across O
the O

was O
slower O

" O
The O
reason O
that O

is O
because O
atmospheric O
scattering O

red O
light O

pass O
through O
the O

the O
composition O

said O
Tom B-PER

" O
And O
the O
density O

cause O

Detective O
Terry B-PER
Raymond E-PER
rode O
along O
with O
the O
FBI S-ORG

day O
. O

Peter B-PER
Van I-PER
Sant E-PER
: O
You O
had O
to O
ask O
the O
question O
, O
" O
Amy S-PER
, O
do O
you O
know O
anyone O
in O
your O
life O
who O
would O
want O
you O
dead O
? O
" O

Det. O
Terry B-PER
Raymond E-PER
: O
Right O
. O
And O
she O
did O
n't O
. O
She O
was O
completely O
shocked O
and O
had O
no O
clue O
who O
it O
could O
possibly O
be O
. O

Raymond S-PER
says O
, O
at O
the O
time O
, O
the O
FBI S-ORG
never O
mentioned O
anything O
to O
him O
or O
the O
Allwines S-PER
about O
Yura S-PER
, O
Besa B-ORG
Mafia E-ORG
or O
Dogdaygod S-PER
, O
but O
they O
told O
her O
there O
was O
a O
murder-for-hire O
plot O
against O
her O
on O
the O
dark O
web O
. O

Det. O
Terry B-PER
Raymond E-PER
: O
It O
was O
the O
FBI S-ORG
's O
investigation O
. O

They O
have O
people O
that O
are O
familiar O
with O
the O
dark B-ORG
web E-ORG
. O
Other O
than O
an O
extra O
patrol O
thing O
, O
it O
's O
not O
something O
that O
we O
would O
get O
involved O
in O
. O

The O
authorities O
advised O
Amy S-PER
and O
her O
husband O
to O
beef O
up O
their O
home O
security O
and O
then O
left O
. O

Capt. O
Randy B-PER
McAlister E-PER
: O
They O
installed O
& O
a O
video O
surveillance O
system O
. O
And O
they O
purchased O
a O
pistol O
. O
So O
they O
had O
taken O
steps O
. O

Jamie B-PER
Kreuser E-PER
: O
And O
Amy B-PER
Allwine E-PER
, O
from O
that O
point O
on O
& O
lived O
with O
this O
knowledge O
that O
someone O
wanted O
her O
dead O
. O

Then O
two O
months O
later O
, O
in O
July O
2016 O
, O
Amy S-PER
got O
another O
death O
threat O
 O
this O
time O
sent O
directly O
to O
her O
. O

Peter B-PER
Van I-PER
Sant E-PER
[ O
reading O
] O
: O
" O
Amy S-PER
, O
I O
still O
blame O
you O
for O
my O
life O
falling O
apart O
Here O
is O
what O
is O
going O
to O
happen O
. O
I O
will O
come O
after O
everything O
else O
that O
you O
love O
. O
" O

Suddenly O
, O
the O
death O
threat O
hung O
over O
Amy S-PER
's O
entire O
family O
, O
including O
her O
son O
, O
Joseph S-PER
, O
then O
8 O
years O
old O
. O

Peter B-PER
Van I-PER
Sant E-PER
[ O
reading O
] O
: O
" O
Here O
is O
how O
you O
can O
save O
your O
family O
. O
Commit O
suicide O
. O
So O
why O
not O
do O
it O
now O
and O
save O
them O
? O
" O

Peter B-PER
Van I-PER
Sant E-PER
: O
How O
seriously O
do O
you O
take O
this O
threat O
? O

Capt. O
Randy B-PER
McAlister E-PER
: O
You O
have O
to O
investigate O
it O
as O
much O
as O
you O
can O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
, O
the O
email O
it O
was O
sent O
from O
& O
was O
anonymized O
, O
so O
it O
was O
untraceable O
. O

But O
someone O
did O
want O
Amy B-PER
Allwine E-PER
dead O
. O
And O
soon O
enough O
she O
would O
be O
. O

Sergeant B-PER
Gwen I-PER
Martin E-PER
was O
just O
starting O
the O
night O
shift O
on O
Nov. O
13 O
, O
2016 O
, O
when O
a O
911 O
call O
came O
in O
that O
made O
many O
on O
the O
Cottage B-LOC
Grove E-LOC
Police O
Department O
drop O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
. O

Sgt. O
Gwen B-PER
Martin E-PER
: O
The O
caller O
was O
telling O
them O
that O
a O
female O
had O
shot O
herself O
. O

911 B-MISC
CALL E-MISC
: O
I O
think O
my O
wife O
shot O
herself O
. O
There O
is O
blood O
all O
over O
. O

Sgt. O
Gwen B-PER
Martin E-PER
: O
We O
get O
in O
the O
squad O
cars O
, O
and O
we O
start O
going O
to O
the O
scene O
. O

As O
an O
18-year O
veteran O
patrol O
cop O
and O
experienced O
paramedic O
, O
Martin S-PER
says O
she O
was O
trained O
to O
be O
ready O
for O
anything O
. O
But O
nothing O
had O
prepared O
her O
for O
a O
message O
she O
received O
from O
dispatch O
about O
half O
way O
through O
her O
six-minute O
drive O
to O
the O
scene O
. O

Sgt. O
Gwen B-PER
Martin E-PER
: O
I O
knew O
it O
was O
Amy S-PER
. O

Martin S-PER
had O
grown O
fond O
of O
Amy B-PER
Allwine E-PER
after O
teaching O
her O
in O
an O
eight-week O
course O
for O
citizens O
to O
learn O
about O
law O
enforcement O
and O
emergency O
services O
. O

They O
'd O
last O
seen O
each O
other O
just O
two O
weeks O
earlier O
at O
graduation O
. O

Sgt. O
Gwen B-PER
Martin E-PER
: O
My O
-- O
my O
heart O
stopped O
. O
No O
. O
This O
is O
n't O
possible O
. O
Amy S-PER
was O
n't O
suicidal O
. O
Amy S-PER
was O
happy O
. O

She O
had O
a O
husband O
. O

She O
had O
a O
son O
. O

What O
possibly O
could O
be O
goin O
' O
on O
? O

As O
Martin S-PER
rounded O
a O
final O
curve O
on O
the O
pitch-black O
country O
road O
, O
the O
taillights O
of O
first O
responders O
at O
the O
scene O
appeared O
in O
her O
windshield O
. O

She O
says O
she O
entered O
the O
house O
still O
hoping O
that O
the O
female O
might O
be O
someone O
other O
than O
Amy S-PER
. O

Peter B-PER
Van I-PER
Sant E-PER
: O
And O
what O
did O
you O
see O
? O

Sgt. O
Gwen B-PER
Martin E-PER
: O
I O
saw O
Amy S-PER
-- O
lying O
on O
the O
floor O
& O
a O
pool O
of O
blood O
& O
A O
blank O
look O
on O
her O
face O
, O
obviously O
dead O
. O

Amy B-PER
Allwine E-PER
was O
sprawled O
on O
the O
bedroom O
floor O
. O

Her O
eyes O
were O
open O
and O
her O
pants O
partially O
unzipped O
. O

Martin S-PER
called O
Capt. O
Randy B-PER
McAlister E-PER
at O
his O
home O
. O

He O
rushed O
to O
the O
scene O
, O
passing O
the O
Allwine S-PER
's O
son O
Joseph S-PER
outside O
the O
house O
. O

The O
boy O
was O
being O
comforted O
by O
his O
father O
Stephen S-PER
. O

McAlister S-PER
says O
he O
expected O
to O
find O
a O
suicide O
. O
But O
once O
in O
the O
house O
, O
his O
nose O
detected O
something O
strange O
. O

A O
pumpkin O
was O
roasting O
in O
the O
kitchen O
. O

Peter B-PER
Van I-PER
Sant E-PER
: O
So O
the O
notion O
would O
be O
that O
Amy B-PER
Allwine E-PER
put O
a O
pumpkin O
in O
the O
roaster O
, O
put O
it O
in O
the O
oven O
and O
then O
shot O
herself O
to O
death O
? O

Capt. O
Randy B-PER
McAlister E-PER
: O
Yeah. O
Yeah O
. O
So O
that O
was O
really O
odd O
. O

Sgt. O
Gwen B-PER
Martin E-PER
: O
It O
does O
n't O
look O
like O
a O
suicide O
. O

Amy S-PER
's O
gunshot O
wound O
was O
easy O
to O
miss O
at O
first O
: O
a O
single O
bullet O
hole O
inside O
her O
right O
ear O
. O
The O
Allwine S-PER
's O
pistol O
was O
lying O
in O
the O
crook O
of O
her O
left O
arm O
, O
which O
was O
perplexing O
because O
Amy S-PER
was O
right O
handed O
. O

Capt. O
Randy B-PER
McAlister E-PER
: O
How O
did O
her O
hand O
end O
up O
under O
the O
bed O
and O
the O
gun O
end O
up O
on O
her O
left O
arm O
? O

Then O
McAlister S-PER
studied O
the O
bloody O
scene O
around O
Amy S-PER
. O

Capt. O
Randy B-PER
McAlister E-PER
: O
I O
noticed O
what O
we O
call O
satellite O
blood O
drips O
that O
were O
actually O
outside O
of O
the O
blood O
pool O
. O

Jamie B-PER
Kreuser E-PER
: O
At O
some O
point O
, O
Amy S-PER
's O
head O
was O
suspended O
above O
those O
drops O
. O

Prosecutor O
Jamie B-PER
Kreuser E-PER
: O
It O
lit O
up O
like O
a O
Christmas O
tree O
! O

Bloody O
footprints O
too O
faint O
to O
be O
seen O
with O
the O
naked O
eye O
suddenly O
appeared O
everywhere O
. O

Capt. O
Randy B-PER
McAlister E-PER
: O
They O
went O
back O
and O
forth O
to O
the O
mud O
room O
& O
But O
they O
also O
went O
into O
the O
bathroom O
on O
the O
main O
floor O
. O
And O
they O
went O
into O
-- O
the O
son O
's O
bedroom O
. O

There O
were O
no O
immediate O
suspects O
. O
Amy S-PER
's O
son O
was O
just O
a O
kid O
, O
her O
husband O
Stephen S-PER
had O
helped O
beef O
up O
security O
at O
the O
house O
after O
the O
FBI S-ORG
's O
warning O
and O
even O
bought O
a O
gun O
. O
He O
agreed O
to O
be O
questioned O
down O
at O
the O
police O
station O
: O

STEPHEN S-PER
ALLWINE O
TO O
POLICE O
: O
We O
're O
a O
normal O
family O
. O
There O
's O
nothing O
-- O
nothing O
unique O
, O
nothing O
strange O
. O

Capt. O
Randy B-PER
McAlister E-PER
: O
The O
thing O
that O
stood O
out O
for O
everybody O
, O
I O
think O
, O
is O
his O
demeanor O
. O

Even O
though O
Stephen S-PER
Allwine S-PER
had O
made O
that O
911 O
call O
, O
McAlister S-PER
says O
Allwine S-PER
was O
oddly O
calm O
for O
someone O
who O
had O
just O
found O
his O
wife O
shot O
to O
death O
. O
Even O
when O
he O
started O
crying O
at O
one O
point O
: O

STEPHEN S-PER
ALLWINE O
TO O
POLICE O
: O
[ O
Sighs O
] O
If O
she O
did O
kill O
herself O
I O
did O
n't O
see O
anything O
comin O
' O
. O
I O
guess O
it O
was O
my O
fault O
[ O
cries O
] O
. O
I O
guess O
l O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
what O
to O
look O
for O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
 O
[ O
picks O
up O
a O
tissue O
] O

Capt. O
Randy B-PER
McAlister E-PER
: O
It O
just O
seemed O
kinda O
fake O
to O
me O
. O

Allwine S-PER
told O
police O
he O
'd O
spent O
the O
morning O
working O
in O
his O
basement O
. O

He O
says O
when O
he O
came O
up O
for O
lunch O
, O
Amy O
was O
n't O
feeling O
well O
. O

Capt. O
Randy B-PER
McAlister E-PER
: O
She O
was O
coming O
down O
with O
something O
. O

Allwine S-PER
said O
he O
'd O
given O
their O
son O
to O
Amy S-PER
's O
parents O
for O
the O
afternoon O
. O

Capt. O
Randy B-PER
McAlister E-PER
: O
He O
left O
the O
house O
at O
roughly O
5:30 O
p.m. O
to O
go O
pick O
his O
son O
up O
from O
the O
grandparents O
' O
house O
. O

From O
there O
, O
Allwine S-PER
says O
he O
took O
his O
son O
for O
dinner O
and O
then O
drove O
home O
. O

Capt. O
Randy B-PER
McAlister E-PER
: O
The O
son O
apparently O
went O
right O
to O
the O
master O
bedroom O
to O
look O
for O
his O
mom O
and O
found O
her O
-- O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

STEPHEN S-PER
ALLWINE O
TO O
911 O
: O
I O
think O
my O
wife O
shot O
herself O
. O
There O
is O
blood O
all O
over O
. O

As O
the O
911 O
call O
went O
on O
, O
Stephen O
Allwine O
's O
distraught O
young O
son O
, O
who O
discovered O
his O
mother O
's O
body O
, O
had O
questions O
: O

JOSEPH S-PER
ALLWINE O
: O
Why O
did O
she O
shoot O
herself O
? O

STEPHEN S-PER
ALLWINE O
: O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
bud O
, O
come O
here O
. O

He O
then O
asked O
: O

JOSEPH S-PER
ALLWINE O
: O
Are O
you O
going O
to O
remarry O
? O

STEPHEN S-PER
ALLWINE O
: O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
bud O
[ O
chuckles O
] O
. O

JOSEPH S-PER
ALLWINE O
: O
I O
'm O
just O
sad O
. O

Peter B-PER
Van I-PER
Sant E-PER
: O
Did O
you O
hear O
what O
I O
heard O
? O
What O
-- O
what O
seemed O
like O
a O
chuckle O
? O

Sgt. O
Gwen B-PER
Martin E-PER
: O
Yeah O
. O

Peter B-PER
Van I-PER
Sant E-PER
: O
There O
was O
nothing O
funny O
in O
that O
room O
, O
in O
that O
scene O
. O

Sgt. O
Gwen B-PER
Martin E-PER
: O
No O
. O
Nothing O
funny O
at O
all O
. O

Although O
Stephen B-PER
Allwine E-PER
's O
behavior O
seemed O
fishy O
in O
the O
911 O
call O
and O
police O
interviews O
, O
McAlister S-PER
said O
there O
was O
no O
apparent O
motive O
for O
him O
to O
kill O
his O
wife O
. O
And O
there O
was O
no O
definitive O
evidence O
linking O
him O
to O
the O
death O
scene O
. O

Peter B-PER
Van I-PER
Sant E-PER
: O
At O
that O
point O
, O
in O
your O
mind O
, O
is O
this O
a O
murder O
case O
? O

Capt. O
Randy B-PER
McAlister E-PER
: O
I O
'm O
thinkin O
' O
it O
's O
a O
murder O
case O
, O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
know O
who O
'd O
done O
it O
. O

Peter B-PER
Van I-PER
Sant E-PER
: O
Amy B-PER
Allwine E-PER
's O
husband O
Stephen S-PER
called O
911 O
. O
I O

it O
here O
. O

The O
Allwine S-PER

Jane B-PER
Sharpe E-PER
[ O

Jane B-PER

: O
I O
think O
they O
failed O
her O
. O
They O
failed O
her O

Peter B-PER
Van I-PER
Sant E-PER
: O
So O
when O
you O
arrived O
at O
the O
residence O
, O
there O
's O
not O
a O
sense O
of O
& O
The O
husband O
might O
be O
someone O
we O
should O
really O
keep O
our O
eye O
on O
? O

Det. O
Terry B-PER
Raymond E-PER
: O
No O
, O
we O
did O
n't O
discuss O
any O
of O
that O
. O

Terry B-PER
Raymond E-PER
and O
Randy B-PER
McAlister E-PER
from O
the O
Cottage B-LOC
Grove E-LOC
Police O
say O
this O
was O
the O
FBI S-ORG
's O
case. O
The O
Feds O
took O
the O
lead O
that O
day O
. O

Local O
police O
say O
they O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
for O
Amy S-PER
: O
warned O
her O
to O
take O
security O
precautions O
and O
increased O
patrols O
in O

Capt. O
Randy B-PER
McAlister E-PER
: O
You O

park O
a O

indefinitely O
outside O

house O
, O
unless O
you O
have O
more O

specific O
information O
. O

" O
48 O
Hours O
" O
wanted O
to O
ask O
the O
FBI S-ORG
about O
the O
Allwine S-PER
case O
, O
but O
the O
Bureau O
declined O
our O
request O
for O
an O
interview O
. O

Since O
2015 O
, O
Chris B-PER
Monteiro E-PER
had O
been O
sounding O
the O
alarm O
about O
dark B-ORG
web E-ORG
murder-for-hire O
sites O
. O
He O
'd O
been O
writing O
online O
articles O
to O
argue O
that O
many O
hit O
man O
sites O
were O
phony O
. O

In O
2016 O
, O
he O
says O
he O
noticed O
someone O
had O
edited O
one O
of O
his O
posts O
about O
Besa B-ORG
Mafia E-ORG
, O
insisting O
it O
was O
real O
. O

Peter B-PER
Van I-PER

Peter B-PER
Van I-PER

the O

the O

that O

all O

very O

" O

Morell S-PER

it O

clear O
" O
the O

learned O
from O

, O
" O
and O
took O
additional O
steps O
this O
time O

cover O

" O
So O
changing O
the O

make O
it O
look O
like O
they O
're O
not O
coming O

changing O
the O

paid O

2016 O
, O
they O
used O

Now O
they O

then O
a O
friend O
put O
it O
on O
Reddit S-ORG

thus O
sparking O
the O
nationwide O
debate O

We O

what O

even O
if O
that O
explains O
which O
word O
was O
originally O
spoken O
, O
what O
accounts O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
some O
listeners O
hear O
something O
completely O
different O
? O

As O
people O
took O
to O
social O

to O
let O
the O
world O
know O
what O
they O
heard O
-- O
and O
argue O
with O
those O
who O
hear O
differently O
-- O
scientists O
were O
trying O
to O
figure O
out O
why O
this O
debate O
even O
exists O
. O
How O
can O
some O
people O
hear O
" O
Yanny O
" O
and O
others O
the O
completely O
different-sounding O
" O
Laurel O
" O
? O

Several O
researchers O
agreed O
that O
the O
audio O
recording O
is O
just O
too O
ambiguous O
. O

Theoretically O
, O
listeners O
can O
hear O
different O
sounds O
depending O
on O
whether O
the O
low O
frequencies O
or O
high O
frequencies O
are O
amplified O
, O
CNET S-ORG
reports O
. O

One O
Twitter S-ORG
user O
proved O
this O
by O
adjusting O
the O
bass O
levels O
of O
the O
original O
recording O
. O
As O
the O
bass O
is O
adjusted O
, O
the O
word O
seems O
to O
shift O
. O

However O
, O
this O
does O
n't O
explain O
why O
someone O
would O
hear O
the O
lower O
frequencies O
and O
some O
hear O
the O
higher O
frequencies O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

What O
could O
alter O
what O
you O
hear O
are O
your O
headphones O
or O
audio O
equipment O
. O

Mediocre O
speakers O
do O
n't O
usually O
play O
both O
quality O
bass O
and O
treble O
. O

But O
what O
if O
two O
people O
are O
both O
listening O
through O
the O
same O
speaker O
and O
hear O
different O
things O
? O
Well O
, O
your O
ears O
just O
might O
be O
different O
. O

" O
If O
I O
cut O
your O
ears O
off O

put O

The O
part O
of O
the O
country O
famous O
for O
its O
" O
Tornado O
Alley O
" O
may O
be O
in O
jeopardy O
of O
losing O
that O
distinction O
. O

A O
new O
study O
says O
the O
tornado O
threat O
zone O
may O
be O
spreading O
eastward O
, O
to O
the O
densely O
populated O
southeastern O
U.S. S-LOC
, O
and O
that O
could O
lead O
to O
a O
" O
threefold O
increase O
" O
in O
disaster O
potential O
. O

One O
of O
the O
study O
's O
authors O
says O
climate O
change O
could O
be O
behind O
the O
shift O
, O
as O
drier O
air O
creeps O
into O
the O
Southeast O
. O

Such O
a O
shift O
would O
be O
good O
news O
the O
southern O
and O
western O
Plains O
states O
, O
but O
a O
threat O
to O
others O
. O

More O
tornadoes O
in O
a O
more O
vulnerable O
area O
is O
a O
recipe O
for O
disaster O
. O

The O
study O
, O
conducted O
by O
two O
severe-weather O
researchers O
, O
Harold B-LOC
Brooks E-LOC
of O
NOAA B-ORG
s E-ORG
National O
Severe O
Storms O
Laboratory O
in O
Oklahoma S-LOC
and O
Dr. O
Victor B-PER
Gensini E-PER
of O
Northern B-ORG
Illinois I-ORG
University E-ORG
, O
noted O
" O
significant O
increasing O
trends O
( O
of O
tornadoes O
) O
in O
portions O
of O
Mississippi S-LOC
, O
Alabama S-LOC
, O
Arkansas S-LOC
, O
Missouri S-LOC
and O
Illinois S-LOC
. O
" O

The O
increased O
risk O
of O
disaster O
is O
due O
to O
a O
combination O
of O
factors O
, O
but O
greater O
vulnerability O
is O
apparently O
the O
biggest O
. O

In O
part O
, O
that O
vulnerability O
stems O
from O
the O
mid-South O
being O
more O
densely O
populated O
, O
meaning O
more O
people O
are O
exposed O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
there O
are O
more O
trees O
in O
the O
region O
and O
that O
, O
combined O
with O
wetter O
, O
" O
rain-wrapped O
" O
storms O
make O
the O
tornadoes O
harder O
to O
see O
. O

Tornadoes O
also O
happen O
more O
often O
at O
night O
in O
these O
areas O
. O

But O
potentially O
the O
most O
dangerous O
factor O
for O
the O
Southeast O
is O
the O
large O
number O
of O
weak-framed O
homes O
there O
. O
According O
to O
Gensini S-PER
, O
half O
of O
tornado O
fatalities O
occur O
in O
weak-framed O
homes O
. O

Researchers O
say O
the O
shift O
eastward O
is O
being O
caused O
by O
the O
creeping O
of O
drier O
, O
desert O
air O
farther O
eastward O
in O
the O
Plains O
states O
. O

In O

, O
moist O
Gulf B-LOC

is O
famously O
called O
the O
Dry O
Line O
. O
That O
's O
where O
much O
of O
the O
severe O
weather O
originates O
. O

But O
a O
recent O
study O
by O
Columbia B-ORG
University E-ORG
substantiates O
the O
movement O
of O
the O
so O
called O
" O
100th O
meridian O
" O
( O
100 O
degrees O
longitude O
) O
eastward O
over O
the O
past O
100 O
years O
. O
Since O
severe O
weather O
forms O
in O
moist O
air O
, O
the O
eastward O
shift O
in O
tornadoes O
makes O
sense O
. O

Gensini S-PER
told O

" O
it O

While O
Hibbert S-PER

was O
clearly O
visible O
on O

, O
doctors O
could O
not O
tell O
what O
type O
it O
was O
without O
removing O
it O
, O
so O
this O
past O
January O
, O
he O
underwent O
surgery O

He O
then O
had O
to O
wait O
two O
long O

" O
How O
good O
would O
it O
be O
if O
I O
knew O
ahead O
of O
time O
before O
, O
we O
did O
surgery O
, O
what O
it O
is O
 O
and O
even O
better O
if O
I O
knew O
what O

it O
had O

so O
I O
can O
tell O
him O
and O
his O
family O
upfront O
, O
'Here O
is O
your O
diagnosis O

here O
is O
your O

then O
here O

what O
we O
need O

do O
about O

' O
And O
some O
cases O
, O
not O
his O
but O
in O
some O
cases O
, O
that O
can O
lead O
to O
avoiding O
surgery O
completely O
if O
you O
have O
an O
inoperable O

, O
" O
Arnaout O
said O
. O

The O
key O
is O
artificial O
intelligence O
. O
" O
In O
broad O
terms O
, O
artificial O
intelligence O
is O
our O
ability O
to O
have O
computers O
do O
stuff O
for O
us O
without O
having O
to O
explicitly O
tell O
the O
computer O
how O
to O
do O
it O
, O
" O
explained O
Arnaout S-PER
. O

He O
and O
a O
team O
of O
researchers O
are O
taking O
thousands O
of O
patient O
MRIs O
, O
matching O
them O
up O
with O
biopsy O
results O
and O
allowing O
a O
computer O
program O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
identify O
a O
tumor O
, O
creating O
a O
virtual O
biopsy O
. O

That O
will O
allow O
doctors O
to O
select O
the O
best O
plan O
of O
action O
and O
give O
patients O
more O
valuable O
information O
about O
their O
prognosis O

Asked O
about O
Hibbert S-PER

, O
Arnaout S-PER
says O
, O
" O
You O
would O
expect O
, O
hopefully O
, O
with O
a O
good O
response O
to O
the O

that O

that O

" O
I O
'm O
the O
kind O
of O
guy O
that O
thinks O
20 O

25 O
years O

" O
he O
said O

" O
At O

that O
I O

I O

" O

ran O
really O

captured O
stopped O

three O

she O
died O

Unfortunately O

there O
's O
no O
easy O
way O
to O
tell O
if O
your O

has O
been O
compromised O
by O

What O
's O
more O
, O
the O
FBI S-ORG
notes O
that O
it O
's O
difficult O
to O
detect O

analyze O
the O

The O
U.S. S-LOC
government O
says O
it O
has O
seized O
a O
critical O
web O
domain O
, O
called O
toknowall.com S-ORG
, O
which O
the O
Russian S-MISC
hackers O
were O
using O
to O
disseminate O
the O
malware O
. O

So O
, O
now O
, O
when O
you O
reboot O
your O
router O
, O
it O
throws O
a O
kink O
in O
their O
system O
, O
essentially O
destroying O
the O
part O
of O
the O
malware O
that O
allows O
hackers O
to O
spy O
on O
your O
activities O
. O

The O
install O
package O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
will O
be O
left O
intact O
. O
After O
a O
reboot O
, O
when O
that O
package O
attempts O
to O
download O
the O
other O
nasty O
parts O
of O
the O
malware O
, O
the O
FBI S-LOC
will O
be O
able O
to O
trace O
it O
. O

Rebooting O
is O
a O
pretty O
easy O
process O
, O
usually O
requiring O
little O
more O
than O
holding O
down O
a O
reset O
button O
on O
the O
router O
, O
CNET S-ORG
explains O
. O

But O
some O
security O
experts O
advise O
that O
a O
factory-reset O
is O
the O
only O
sure-fire O
way O
to O
purge O
VPNFilter O
from O
a O
router O
. O
Once O
that O
's O
done O
, O
you O
'll O
have O
to O
reconfigure O
all O
your O

Check O

By O
now O
fire O
season O
in O
California S-LOC
should O
be O
wrapping O
up O
. O
Instead O
there O
are O
more O
than O
a O
dozen O
fires O
burning O
across O

. O

But O
why O
are O
such O
volatile O

persisting O
past O

, O
into O
mid-November O
? O

There O
are O
many O
answers O
, O
involving O
both O
current O
weather O
and O
longer O
term O

. O

Right O
now O
a O
combination O
of O
dry O
ground O
, O
low O
relatively O
humidity O
and O
gusty O
winds O
from O
the O
mountains O
are O
making O
conditions O
ripe O
for O

on O
Sunday O

were O
clocked O
over O
50 O

But O
there O
is O
good O
news O
for O
the O
northern O
half O
of O
the O
state O
. O
Winds O
are O
forecast O
to O
slow O
down O
making O
the O
fires O
easier O
to O
fight O
. O

Recently O
, O
it O
's O
been O
very O
dry O
in O
the O
Golden B-LOC
State E-LOC
. O
Over O
the O
past O
30 O
days O
, O
most O
of O
California S-LOC
has O
seen O
little O
if O
any O
rain O
. O

While O
normal O
values O
of O
rain O
are O
only O
a O
couple O
of O
inches O
the O
first O
half O
of O
autumn O
, O
any O
lack O
of O
rain O
at O
the O
very O
end O
of O
fire O
season O
, O
even O
an O
inch O
or O
two O
, O
exacerbates O
an O
already O
grave O
fire O
threat O
. O
The O
ground O
is O
parched O
and O
the O
brush O
is O
like O
a O

In O
the O
longer O

a O
more O
elaborate O

emerges O

the O
evidence O
points O
to O
dangerous O
wildfires O
, O

But O
starting O
in O

, O
emissions O

Measurements O
from O
a O

it O

to O
